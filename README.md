Hello visitor to my development space. I'm a Dynamic Systems Engineer with a
Epimelis Philosophos structured thinking and a Swarga Díkşhaņa inspiration. Thus, I 
love to develop algorithms and data structures in the most diverse languages, from C 
to Web, and, likewise, I love to analyse the most diverse subjects, from concrete matters 
to abstract orientation. My interests are in the fields of informatics and information,
technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom.
