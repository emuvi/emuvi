Hello visitor to the development space of Éverton M. Vieira. I'm a Systems Engineer and an Epimelis Philosophus with a Swarga Díkşhaņa inspiration. Thus, I love to develop algorithms and data structures in the most diverse languages, from C to Web, and, likewise, I love to analyse the most diverse subjects, from concrete matters to abstract orientation. My interests are in the fields of informatics and information, technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom. My pairs of interests also synthesizes what I believe to be the ideal synergy between practice and theory.
