# Ã‰verton M. Vieira

Hello visitor to my development space. I'm a Dynamic Systems Engineer with a Philosophic
Structured Illustration. Thus, I love to develop algorithms and data structures in the most
diverse languages, from C to Web, and, likewise, I love to analyze the most diverse subjects,
from concrete matters to abstract orientation. My interests are in the fields of informatics
and information, technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom.
