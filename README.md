Hello visitor to my development space. I'm a Dynamic Systems Engineer and an
Epimelis Philosophos with a Swarga Díkşhaņa orientation. Thus, I love to develop
algorithms and data structures in the most diverse languages, from C to Web, and,
likewise, I love to analyse the most diverse subjects, from concrete matters to
abstract orientation. My interests are in the fields of informatics and information,
technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom.
