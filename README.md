Hello visitor, this is Ã‰verton Vieira's development space. I'm a software engineer and a free thinker. Thus, I love to develop algorithms and data structures in the most diverse languages, from C to Web, and, likewise, I love to write about the most diverse subjects, from exact sciences to abstract philosophy. My interests are in the fields of informatics and information, technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom. These pairs of interests also synthesizes what I believe to be the ideal synergy between practice and theoretical knowledge.
