Hello visitor to the development space of Éverton M. Vieira. I'm a Software Engineer and a Epimelis Philosophus with a Swarga Díkşhaņa inspiration. Thus, I love to develop algorithms and data structures in the most diverse languages, from C to Web, and, likewise, I love to mentor on the most diverse subjects, from exact matters to abstract orientation. My interests are in the fields of informatics and information, technology and epistemology, intelligence and wisdom. These pairs of interests also synthesizes what I believe to be the ideal synergy between practice and theoretical knowledge.
